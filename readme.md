## Setup
1. **Database Table Creation**  
   The theme will automatically create the necessary table during activation using the `dbDelta` function. Ensure that the database user has the required permissions.

2. **Link the Popup to Buttons**  
   Use the custom `data-popup-id` attribute on buttons to specify which popup to trigger:
   ```html
   <button class="popup-trigger" data-popup-id="1">Open Popup</button>
Customization
Styles: Modify style.css to change the appearance of the popup.
Behavior: Adjust popup.js for custom JavaScript behavior.
Database: Update the structure in includes/database.php to store additional information.
