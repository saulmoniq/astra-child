 Please create a popup form that collects user information and saves it to a table in the database. Please
 adhere to the following:
 • You will use the button titled, "Send Me More Information" in the "How it Works" section to
 trigger your popup.
 • The popup should be centered on the screen and blur the main site content.
 • The popup should fade in rather than appear suddenly.
 • Clicking outside of the form area should close the popup.
 • Form data should be sanitized prior to insertion into the database.
 • The form data should be saved without refreshing the page.
 • Display a message to the user after the save operation has completed or failed.
 • You may choose to have the message and popup fade out after [x] seconds or provide a way for
 the user to manually close. This is your choice.
 • Please stick to using colors in the site's scheme.
 • Please do not install any plugins to complete this task.
